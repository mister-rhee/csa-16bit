# What is this?
This is a 16-bit carry-select adder I designed using Cadence Virtuoso<br><br>

Carry-select adders offer much lower propagation delays over traditional ripple-carry adders by calculating the sum in chunks ahead of time (4 bits in this design), which are then selected by carry-in bit of the previous chunk<br><br>

This design is built from the ground-up for balanced high-to-low and low-to-high propagation delays<br><br>
